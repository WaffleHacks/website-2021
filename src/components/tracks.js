The transition from having a lively customer experience to transactional interactions due to health and safety concerns was something we did not expect to happen. Some businesses and restaurants were able to adapt to these changes, while others suffered. With this, the way we conduct local business is no longer what it used to be.",

Students who relied on school lunches and meal plans were left with little to no options once schools across the nation shut down. Even with local and national organizations helping these students, things like safe distribution of food and accessibility to resources remain an issue.",
