# WaffleHacks Landing Page

This is the landing page for the Waffle Hacks hackathon.
It is a modified version of the [Gatsby Tailwind Starter](https://github.com/app-generator/gatsbyjs-starter-tailwindplay) made by AppSeed.

The countdown clock is a modified version of the countdown timer in [this blog post](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/05/countdown-built-with-react/).
